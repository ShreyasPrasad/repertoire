## Repertoire

Tool to help me memorize chess openings. Built as a CLI application that loads and manages `.opening` files. Contains some tools for interacting with and annotating an opening you are exploring.

### `The .opening` file format

This is a JSON-like format for saving an opening study. Save your openings using this file format. Here's an example for the Caro Kann:

```
{   
    "author": "Shreyas",
    "date_modified": "1749349708",
    "name": "Caro Kann",
    "description": "Collection of common Caro Kann ideas. Collected from a bunch of different YouTube videos",
    "moves": {
        "e4": {
            "note": "The move that black responds most often to with the Caro Kann."
        },
        "e4-c6-d4-d5-e5": {
            "note": "The advanced Caro Kann. White fights for space and black must quickly develop."
        }
    }
}
```
